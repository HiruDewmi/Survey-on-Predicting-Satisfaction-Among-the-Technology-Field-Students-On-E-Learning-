# Survey-on-Predicting-Satisfaction-Among-the-Technology-Field-Students-On-E-Learning-



Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has forced the immediate closure of schools and colleges around the world. To ensure educational continuity, a shift from traditional teaching to e-learning was required. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence students' satisfaction and continued interest in e-learning. A questionnaire was distributed to undergraduate government university students in the technology field from various universities in Sri Lanka. Using a validated self-administered questionnaire, the study combines the expectation-confirmation theory and the theory of planned behavior to predict students' satisfaction and intention to continue using e-learning. The structural equation model was used to analyze the results and evaluate the study's hypotheses. Satisfaction levels were determined using a five-point Likert scale. and approximately 100 students responded to the questionnaire. Out of the responses, 36 percent of students prefer online platforms for learning, while 30 percent prefer a hybrid (face-to-face learning with online learning) method for education. As a result, studies show that students in the technology field are unaffected by the transition from on-site learning to online learning. Their level of satisfaction with online education appears to be average
